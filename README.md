# Emotion Detection from Comments using NLP

## Getting Started

### Overview

This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform emotion detection from text comments. The goal is to classify comments into different emotion categories, including sadness, love, surprise, joy, anger, and fear. The model selection, preprocessing steps, and the final chosen model are detailed in the .ipynb file provided.

### Installation

To explore the project, you have a few options:

#### Option 1: View the .ipynb file

If you prefer to review the project without installing any dependencies, you can simply open and explore the provided Jupyter Notebook. It contains step-by-step details of the model selection process, preprocessing steps, and the final evaluation metrics.


#### Option 2: Use the Pretrained Model

If you're interested in the final trained model and don't want to go through the entire process, you can use the provided pretrained model directly.


### Model Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the emotion detection model was assessed using various evaluation metrics. Below are the results achieved on the test dataset:
